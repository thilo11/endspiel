//! Hand-crafted evaluation for endgames the net cannot convert on its own.
//!
//! Without tablebases the NNUE has no gradient in these endings: it knows
//! K+B+N vs K is "won" but not that the lone king must be driven into a corner
//! of the bishop's colour, and in K+Q vs K+R it has no notion of progress, so
//! the search shuffles into a repetition or the 50-move rule. It also scores
//! K+minor vs K as a piece up, so hanging a piece in K+B+N vs K looks harmless.
//! Measured on 2026-09-29 (TB off, 1 s/move vs Stockfish 19 + Syzygy, 12 random
//! TB-won positions each): K+B+N vs K 1/12 -> 12/12 mated, K+Q vs K+R 6/12 ->
//! 12/12; the other ten classic endings (KQK, KRK, KBBK, KPK, KQKP, Lucena- and
//! Philidor-type KRPKR, KRKB, KRKN) stayed 40/40 won or held.
//!
//! Tablebases take precedence: the root is ranked by DTZ and interior nodes
//! probe WDL after zeroing moves, before any static eval. These rules only
//! fill in where no probe answers (TB off, or hmc > 0 inside a conversion).
//!
//! Each rule returns a score for the side to move and replaces the net's value
//! for that exact material; everything else returns `None`. The scores stay
//! far below the tablebase (28 000) and mate (29 000+) bands.
